# What is K8s?

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.  

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s".  

Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Netflix was one of the first companies to have integrated K8s to their stack.  

# Why you need Kubernetes?

Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications.   
In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime.   
For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. Wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?
